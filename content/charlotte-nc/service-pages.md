### Common Roof Repairs in Charlotte

**Leak Repair**
Charlotte's heavy spring rains and summer storms often reveal hidden roof problems. Our contractors can identify and fix leaks quickly, preventing water damage to your home's interior.

*Signs you need leak repair:*
- Water stains on ceilings or walls
- Dripping water during rain
- Musty odors in attic

*When to repair shingles:*
- Missing shingles visible from ground

- Granules in gutters
- Exposed nail heads

**Flashing Repair**
Flashing around chimneys, vents, and skylights is a common failure point. Proper flashing repair prevents leaks at roof penetrations.

**Gutter-Related Repairs**
Clogged or damaged gutters can cause water to back up under roofing materials. Our contractors address gutter issues as part of comprehensive roof repair.

## H1: Storm Damage Roof Repair in Charlotte, NC

### Intro
Charlotte experiences an average of 2-3 significant hail storms per year, plus occasional high winds from tropical systems. When storm damage strikes, you need a roofing contractor who responds quickly and works with your insurance company.
